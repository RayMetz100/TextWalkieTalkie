output Push pull
input pull down


• Input floating  00
• Input pull-up   01  a resistor connected to high 
• Input-pull-down 10   a resistor connected to low 

Mode = 00

        float low
         check for high

like an LED
OUTPUT high, start low, pull down

Mode 01

open-drain OTYPER = 1
Open drain mode: A “0” in the Output register activates the N-MOS whereas a “1”
in the Output register leaves the port in Hi-Z (the P-MOS is never activated)

0 goes to ground
1 goes to Hi-Z

PUPD
00 = OD        a transistor connects to low and nothing else
01 = OD + PU   a transistor connects to low, and a resistor connects to high 
10 = OD + PD

push-pull OTYPER = 0
Push-pull mode: A “0” in the Output register activates the N-MOS whereas a “1” in
the Output register activates the P-MOS
PUPD
00 = PP         a transistor connects to high, and a transistor connects to low (only one is operated at a time)
01 = PP + PU
10 = PP + PD
